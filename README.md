# Hey there!

### This project is a great starting point for a .NET 8 console application. 
Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s cool about it:

1- Iâ€™ve set up Serilog to log both to the console and to files asynchronously, super handy for tracking what happened and when!

2- Iâ€™ve added .NETâ€™s built-in Dependency Injection.

3- Configurations using appsettings, I've added separate configs for local, development and production environments.

## How It Works

Running the App: Simply hit run! The app is set up to make an http call to a sample endpoint that will display the results back in the console.

Thatâ€™s pretty much it! Happy coding! ðŸ˜€
